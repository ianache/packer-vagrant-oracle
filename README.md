packer-vagrant-oracle
==============

A list of Packer and Vagrant files for oracle products.

This is work in progress, and I will be updating this page.


# Why YAPOV page?

This is a Yet Abother Packer or Vagrant page.

After checking around what's available, just found examples and machines related to other EL or debian/ubuntu linux.

This collection of files will be focused on [Oracle Linux], Oracle [VirtualBox] as main base products.

On top of these products, will be integrating scripts to deploy Oracle Clusterware, Oracle Asm, Oracle Database and other products.

## Requirements

For quick start:

* [Vagrant] and [VirtualBox] installed.
* At least 4 GB of RAM.

For custom build:

* [Packer] installed
* [Vagrant] installed
* [VirtualBox] installed
* [OracleLinux ISO] available

## Installation

* Clone this project:

        $ 'git clone https://github.com/kikitux/packer-vagrant-oracle.git'
        
* Ora download this [project] as zip file


## Getting Started


### Oracle Linux ISO files

### Packer

### Vagrant


* Run `vagrant up` from the base directory of this project. It takes a while..

## Troubleshooting
Sometimes installation of domain fails at the first time. In that case run install_domain.sh more than one time :)
